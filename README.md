# AI_chatbot
This AI chatbot uses deep learning (DialoGPT) to generate human-like responses. It processes user input, maintains conversation history, and responds contextually. Built with Python, PyTorch, and Transformers, it can be enhanced with custom training, web integration, or voice input for real-world applications. ðŸš€
